## Hello ##

Welcome to my Google Homepage

The goal of this project is to challenge my programming skills by recreating Google. Since google is so broad I decided to focus on key aspects.   

Ideally I’d want to have a mock Google Store, A workable search engine, and a profile, where you can add and delete. I’ve added a small demo with just cosmetics. I have not added functionality as of yet, but I will work on this. So far I’ve been working in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I would like to move the project into a React framework with a possible backend using Express, and MongoDB.
